# Mozambique Developer Survey (1st Edition)
"Mozambique Developers Survey" is a comprehensive survey organized by MOZDEVZ to explore the world of developers in Mozambique. The first edition took place in 2023, where data was collected through an online questionnaire shared via a link on social media and developer groups in Mozambique.
In this survey, we delve into the realm of technology and the development of technological solutions. The survey was conducted with over 600 aspiring and experienced developers in Mozambique, ranging in age from 14 to 59 years old.
